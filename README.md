# Space Shooter Game

This is a simple 2D space shooter game developed in Python using the Tkinter library. In this game, the player controls a spaceship and must shoot down enemy ships while avoiding collisions with them.

## Features

- **Player Control**: Use arrow keys or WASD keys to move the player spaceship.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: Press the spacebar key to shoot projectiles at enemy ships.
- **Enemy Ships**: Enemy ships appear randomly on the screen and move downwards towards the player.
- **Scoring**: Players earn points for shooting down enemy ships.
- **Health System**: The player has limited health, and collisions with enemy ships reduce it. The game ends if the player's health reaches zero.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/space-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## How to Play
